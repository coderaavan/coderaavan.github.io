Hi! I am Prashant. I am currently pursuing M.Tech in Computer Science and Technology from IIT Bombay. 
I have an active interest in systems based subjects, specifically Operating Systems and Computer Architecture. I have started exploring these domains only after coming to IIT Bombay, so I am very novice in the area but I am taking small steps at a time. I am proficient with C, C++, Python. Owing to my working experience of 1 year in Risk and Financial Advisory, I am good with GRC tools like ServiceNow and RSA Archer. I am a Certified System Administrator for ServiceNow.

Drop me a mail if you will prefer further interaction.
