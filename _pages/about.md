Hi! I am Prashant. I am an M.Tech student in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I have an active interest in systems based subjects, specifically Operating Systems and Computer Architecture and as a result I am a part of **Computer Architecture for Security and Performance ([CASPER](https://casper-iitb.github.io/))** research group, working with [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/). I have started exploring these domains only after coming to IIT Bombay, so I am very novice in the area but I am taking small steps at a time. 

Currently, I am working on improving virtual to physical address translation speed in modern processors which, in turn can boost application performance significantly in native as well as virtualized systems.

Owing to my working experience of 1 year in Risk and Financial Advisory, I am good with GRC tools like ServiceNow and RSA Archer. I am a Certified System Administrator for ServiceNow.

Drop me a mail if you will prefer further interaction.
